        traits => [qw(Getopt)],
        isa => "Bool",
        is  => "rw",
        cmd_aliases   => "X",
        documentation => "use the blortext algorithm",
    );

    has recheck => (
        traits => [qw(Getopt)],
        isa => "Bool",
        is  => "rw",
        cmd_aliases => "r",

    );

    sub execute {
        my ( $self, $opt, $args ) = @_;

        # you may ignore $opt, it's in the attributes anyway
        
        my $result = $self->blortex ? blortex() : blort();

        recheck($result) if $self->recheck;

        print $result;
    } 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module marries L<App::Cmd> with L<MooseX::Getopt>.

Use it like L<App::Cmd> advises (especially see L<App::Cmd::Tutorial>),
swapping L<App::Cmd::Command> for L<MooseX::App::Cmd::Command>.

Then you can write your moose commands as moose classes, with L<MooseX::Getopt>
defining the options for you instead of C<opt_spec> returning a
L<Getopt::Long::Descriptive> spec.
